Notes MD - Features coming up
========

The tool is by no means complete. I am working on the tool in my spare time and adding features or fixing problems as fast as I can. However I do have demanding job and family. So the speed of improvements will not be always great.

Here is something that you can expect in next few days.

 4. Tag cloud and ability to search notes using tags
 5. General polishing. You might have noticed HTML UI is not my strongest skill
 7. Ubuntu packaging/create PPA and make it available through ubuntu app channel. Right now I have no idea how to do it, but am sure google search will enlight me.
